# Covid19_analysis
ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization of the COVID-19 pandemic across various countries, focusing on infection trends and their possible correlation with World Happiness metrics such as GDP per capita, social support, life expectancy, and more.

Using real-world datasets, we analyze the spread of the virus, compare infection rates among countries, and build regression models to investigate how different socio-economic factors might relate to the severity of the outbreak.

ðŸ“Š Objectives
Clean and preprocess global COVID-19 datasets.

Analyze the spread and peak infection rates across countries.

Merge COVID-19 data with World Happiness Report data.

Explore relationships between happiness indicators and infection trends.

Visualize findings using scatter plots, line graphs, and regression analysis.

Identify which socio-economic factors may influence infection outcomes.

ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
